Introduction:
    - When reading an analysis it is very common to face confidence intervals
    - For instance
        - *Example, probably vaccine efficacy*
    - But, unfortunately, it's interpretation is not so easy
Definition:
    - Rough definition:
        - *Using colors* A reported [L, U] confidence interval of p% for a quantity q means that if a lot of scientists reproduced the same experiment, we would expected that p% of the calculated confidence intervals contained the true unknown quantity.
    - Using the same example:
        - *Definition applied to the example*
Simulation:
    - This is still pending more thoughts, maybe do a simulation showing
References:
    - Reference for example




Thoughts:
    - If time allows, add one more example
